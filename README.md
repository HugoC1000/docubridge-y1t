# ModelMind: DocuBridge’s AI Financial Modeling Assistant

ModelMind is a browser-based AI assistant that simplifies financial modeling and analysis. Users can upload Excel files and ask natural-language questions about the data. Powered by Google's Gemini, ModelMind responds with clear, human-readable insights — no Excel plugin or technical background required.

Created as part of the **Harvard Undergraduate Ventures-Tech Summer Program (HUVTSP 2025)**, this tool helps make financial models more accessible, especially for junior analysts, students, and non-technical users.

**Disclaimer:** This project is a prototype created for educational purposes during the **Harvard Undergraduate Ventures-Tech Summer Program (HUVTSP 2025)**. It is not officially affiliated with **DocuBridge, OpenAI, or Microsoft Excel**. All financial models used for testing should be public sample data only. Do not upload any sensitive, private, or proprietary files.
